## A Penny for Your Thoughts...
Welcome to PEN-NY, a place for New Yorkers to share their thoughts and connect with other locals in the concrete jungle.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML/CSS** - PEN-NY is based on [this](https://github.com/rosendopili/PEN-NY-CHAT) project, with an updated front end design. We used HTML & CSS to build  a new single page version of the site.

* **JavaScript** - We used JS to create an engaging and responsive user interface and add functionality to elements such as user signup, login and posting.

* **Java/PSQL** - The PEN-NY API is built with Java and a Postgres relational database which houses all user data and input.

* **Spring Boot** - This easy to use Spring framework allowed us to quickly develop and run the PEN-NY app on the embedded Tomcat server.



### Our Approach
We began this iteration of PEN-NY by building the backend with Spring Boot. The first couple of days were mostly pair-programming and debugging any issues that arose as we went along. We started the backend code from scratch a few times before getting all of our needed dependencies, folders and classes to work as they should.
After building all of the necessary Java classes and mapping them to our Postgres database, we began populating the database and testing the functionality of our API with Postman.

### Major Hurdles
As with any project, there were a few stumbling blocks. Our first round of pair programming went smoothly, but there turned out to be errors in creating our classes. We also experienced challenges with getting our user sign up and login functions to persistently work.
